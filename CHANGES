trunk (unreleased)
* Update to new io-page{,.unix} ocamlfind structure

1.2.0 (18-Dec-2013)
* Fix a serious race condition exposed when multiple threads access
  the same block device
* Block.connect: open in buffered mode if the filename has prefix "buffered:".
  The default is still to use unbuffered (like mirage-block-xen)

1.1.0 (16-Dec-2013)
* Expose the `blkgetsize` function in the external signature.
* Regenerate build files with OASIS 0.4.0

1.0.0 (08-Dec-2013)
* depend on mirage-types-0.4.0+
* catch low-level I/O errors and return an `Error
* Reformat with `ocp-indent` to deal with the outrageously large monitors that Citrix use.

0.1.1 (2-Dec-2013)
* add missing file

0.1.0 (1-Dec-2013)
